# Flappy-Bird
***
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of barriers that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of barriers awards the player with point. Colliding with a barrier or the ground ends the gameplay.
